The Lone Writer's Guide is one of the projects happening at [San Francisco Write The docs.] (https://goo.gl/A6EBEn)

 About This Guide
If you're the new sole writer at a company and you've inherited a mess, what should you do first? What decisions (and trade-offs) must you address right away? What milestones would you try to hit in the first 30, 60, and 90 days?

We started a guide for people who are thrown into the deep end to give them a plan for the first 90 days. This hack-a-thon is to continue that work.

Everyone has something to share, so join us for this project, if you are (or have been) the sole writer at a company, a writer with lots of experience.
